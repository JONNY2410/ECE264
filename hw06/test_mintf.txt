Does the code work?
print 1, 1024 
ok, looks decimal works, how about hex 0x400
how about binary, int_min: -0x80000000
int_max 0x7fffffff
int_min in binary: -0b10000000000000000000000000000000
good, good, let's try some double, my favorite double is -$2147483648.98
great, other double like $2147483647.99
some strings maybe? : Jonny is a cool kid
characters? : Y
end with %
